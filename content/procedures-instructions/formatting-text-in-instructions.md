## In documentation and technical content

Use these conventions in instructions that appear in documentation and technical content.

| **Element** | **Convention** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Buttons, checkboxes, and other options** | Avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a button, checkbox, or other option, use bold formatting for the name.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI. If an option label ends with a colon or an ellipsis, don't include that end punctuation in instructions.   Don't include the type of UI element, such as *button* or *checkbox,* unless including it adds needed clarity. | Select **Save as** (*not* Select **Save as…** or Select the **Save as** button).   Select **Allow row to break across pages**.   Clear the **Match case** checkbox. |
| **Command-line commands** | Code style. | `copy` |
| **Command-line options (also known as switches or flags)** | Code style. Capitalize the way the option must be typed. | `/a`   `/Aw` |
| **Commands** | Use bold formatting for command names.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI. If a command label ends with a colon or an ellipsis, don't include that end punctuation in instructions.   Don't include the word *command* unless it adds needed clarity. | Go to **Tools**, and select **Change language**.   On the **Design** menu, select **Colors**, and then select a color scheme. |
| **Database names** | Bold. Code style if using in code syntax. The capitalization of database names varies. | **WingtipToys** database   Enter the command `USE WingtipToys;` |
| **Device and port names** | All uppercase. | USB |
| **Dialog boxes** | In general, avoid talking about UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do.   When you need to refer to the UI element, use *dialog*. Don't use *pop-up window*, *dialog box*, or *dialogue box*.   When you must refer to a dialog by name, use bold formatting for its name.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI. If a dialog label ends with a colon or an ellipsis, don't include that end punctuation in instructions. | Select **Upload**, and then select a file to upload.   In **Properties**, select **Details**, and then select **Remove Properties and Personal Information**.   In the **Protect document** dialog, clear the **Shapes** checkbox. |
| **Error messages** | Sentence-style capitalization. Enclose error messages in quotation marks when you're referring to them in text. | Looks like that's a broken link.   If you see the error message "Check scanner status and try again," use Windows Update to check for the latest drivers for your device. |
| **File attributes** | All lowercase. | To remove the hidden attribute from all files in a folder.... |
| **File name extensions** | All lowercase. | .mdb   .doc |
| **File names (user-defined examples)** | Title-style capitalization. It's OK to use internal capital letters in file names for readability. Use bold formatting for file names in procedures if you're directing the customer to select, type, or otherwise interact with the name. Apply code style if using in code syntax. | My Taxes for 2025   Enter **MyTaxesFor2025**.   `copy MyTaxesFor2025.txt` |
| **Folder and directory names (user-defined examples)** | Sentence-style capitalization. It's OK to use internal capital letters in folder and directory names for readability. In procedures, use bold formatting for names if you're directing the customer to select, type, or otherwise interact with the name. Apply code style if using in code syntax. | Vacation and Sick Pay   MyFiles\\Accounting\\Payroll\\VacPay   Select **Documents**   `cd MyFiles\Projects` |
| **Key names, combinations, and sequences** | Capitalize. Use bold formatting for key names and keyboard shortcuts in instructions. Don't put a space around the plus sign (+) in keyboard shortcuts.   To learn how to refer to keyboard shortcuts and specific keys, see [Keys and keyboard shortcuts term collection](../a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/keys-keyboard-shortcuts). | Shift, F7   Ctrl+Alt+Del   Alt, F, O   Spacebar   Select the **F1** key.   To open the **Preview** tab, select **Alt+3**. |
| **Macros** | Usually all uppercase. Use bold formatting if predefined. Might be code style if user-defined or in code-related content. Treatment varies. | **LOWORD**   `MASKROP` |
| **Markup language elements (tags)** | Code style. Capitalization varies. | `<img>`   `<input type="text">` |
| **Mathematical constants and variables** | Italic. | *a2 + b2 = c2* |
| **Menus** | Avoid talking about menus. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a menu by name, use bold formatting for the name of the menu.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Don't include the word *menu* unless it adds needed clarity. | Go to **Tools**, and select **Change language**.   On the **Design** menu, select **Colors**, and then select a color scheme. |
| **New terms** | Italicize the first mention of a new term if you're going to define it immediately in text. | Microsoft Exchange consists of both *server* and *client* components. |
| **Palettes** | Avoid talking about palettes. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a palette by name, use bold formatting for the name of the palette.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Don't include the word *palette* unless it adds needed clarity. | In **Colors**, let Windows pull an accent color from your background, or choose your own color.   In the **Color** palette, select a color for the object outline. |
| **Panes** | Avoid talking about panes. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a pane by name, use bold formatting for the name of the pane.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Don't include the word *pane* unless it adds needed clarity. | Select the arrow next to the **Styles** gallery, select **Apply styles**, and then select a style to modify.   If the **Apply Styles** pane is in your way, just move it. |
| **Placeholders (in syntax and in user input)** | Italic when the placeholder element is UI text. Use angle brackets for code placeholders when angle brackets aren't part of the language syntax. | Enter *password*.   `/v: <version>` |
| **Products, services, apps, and trademarks** | Usually title-style capitalization. Check the [Microsoft trademark list](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks) for capitalization of trademarked names. | Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse   Microsoft Word   Surface Pro   Notepad   Network Connections   Makefile   RC program |
| **Slashes** | When you're instructing customers to enter a slash, include the spelled-out term (*backslash* or *slash*), followed by the symbol in parentheses. | Enter two backslashes (\\\\).... |
| **Strings** | When you're referring to strings in code, a document, a website, or UI, use sentence-style capitalization unless the text you're referring to is capitalized differently. Enclose in quotation marks, or use code style when you're referring to a code string. | Select "Now is the time."   Find `font-family:Segoe UI Semibold` in the code. |
| **Tabs** | Avoid talking about tabs. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a tab by name, use bold formatting for the name of the tab.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Don't include the word *tab* unless it adds needed clarity. | Select the table, and then select **Design** > **Header row**.   On the **Design** tab, select **Header row**.   Go to the **Deploy** tab. In the **Configuration** list, …. |
| **Toggles** | Avoid talking about toggles. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a toggle by name, use bold formatting for the name of the toggle.   Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Include the word *toggle* if it adds needed clarity. | To make text and apps easier to see, turn on the toggle under **Turn on high contrast**.   To keep all applied filters, turn on the **Pass all filters** toggle. |
| **URLs** | All lowercase for complete URLs. If necessary, line-break long URLs before a slash. Don't hyphenate.   See also [URLs and web addresses](../urls-web-addresses). | www.microsoft.com   www.microsoft.com/download |
| **User input** | Usually lowercase, unless case sensitive. Bold or italic, depending on the element. If the user input string contains placeholder text, use italic for that text. | Enter **hello world**   Enter *password* |
| **Windows** | Avoid talking about windows. Instead, focus on what the customer needs to do.   When you must refer to a window by name, use bold formatting for the name of the window. Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.   Use *window* only as a generic term for an area on a PC screen where apps and content appear. Don't use *window* to refer to a specific dialog box, pane, or similar UI element. | To embed the new object, switch to the source document.   Easily switch between open windows.   Open a new Microsoft Edge tab in a new window so you can look at tabs side by side. |
| **XML schema elements** | Code style. Often surrounded by angle brackets. Capitalization varies. | `ElementType` element   `<xml:space>` |

## In the UI and general content

Instructions can also appear in the UI itself and in content other than documentation, such as blogs and marketing. In this content, avoid bold and italic formatting. The goal is to be readable and friendly but also clearly set off the UI label or other text element from the surrounding text.

Choose one of the following approaches and use it consistently.

| **Option** | **Example** |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the action without referring to a specific UI label. | Choose the group or groups that you want to assign services to. |
| Use wording that clearly sets off the name of the element. | Assign services to the Business data only group.   By selecting the Create my database button, you agree Microsoft can use entity and field names you create to help improve our common data model.   Choose how often you want to refresh data in Schedule refresh. |
| Use quotation marks. Quotation marks can make text cluttered, so use them sparingly and only when necessary for clarity. | Assign services to the "No business data allowed" group. |
| Use bold formatting. | Assign services to either the **Business data only** or **No business data allowed** group. |
